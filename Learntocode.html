      <h3>Learn to code</h3>
      <p>I really push people to learn to code no matter who they are because technology helps move the world forward, you use it in everyday life. Why not a computer have some a problem for you that takes it seconds but for you it would maybe take an hour. Or maybe you just want to be able to build your website without paying a middle man to do it so you can run your business by yourself completely forms of coding languages give you this power.</p>
      <h3>What are some of the languages computers use?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Html: stands for hypertext markup language and it is used for the structure and content of webpages</li>
        <li>CSS: is used for styling html.</li>
        <li>Java: Java is an object-oriented language invented at Sun Microsystems. It may be used to develop stand-alone applications that operate on a single computer, applications that run over the Internet from a Web server, and applets that run in a Web browser</li>
        <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that can used in a Web site to perform simple operations. Despite its name, it is not related to Java.</li>
        <li>PHP: A programming language used primarily for developing Web server applications and dynamic Web pages.</li>
        <li>Python: Python is an object-oriented programming language used in both business and academia. Many popular Web sites contain features developed in Python</li>
        <li>Ruby: Ruby is a simple but powerful object-oriented programming language. It can be used for a variety of purposes, from small utility programs to large Web applications.</li>
      </ul>
      </il>
